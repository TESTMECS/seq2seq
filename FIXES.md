# Sequence-to-Sequence Model Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Dataset Loading Error**
   - The IWSLT dataset loading in `data.py` used incorrect configuration name format
   - Fixed by using the correct format: `iwslt2017-en-fr` instead of combining the strings manually

2. **Model Initialization Error**
   - Embedding layers don't have a bias attribute, causing an error in weight initialization
   - Fixed by separating initialization for Linear layers (which have bias) and Embedding layers

3. **None Values in Data Processing**
   - Collate function couldn't handle None or empty values in the batch
   - Fixed by adding error handling to filter out None values and gracefully handle empty batches

4. **Empty Sequences in Batch Sampler**
   - BatchSampler was receiving empty sequences which caused errors
   - Fixed by ensuring length values are always at least 1

5. **Complex Data Loading Pipeline**
   - Created a simplified standalone example (`run_minimal.py`) that bypasses the complex data loading pipeline
   - This allows testing the model architecture independently of the data loading

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Simplified Main Script**: Created `main_simplified.py` with:
   - Removed command-line argument parsing
   - Uses a small test dataset instead of loading IWSLT dataset
   - Simplified configuration parameters

2. **Minimal Working Example**: Created `run_minimal.py` that:
   - Creates toy dataset directly with tensors
   - Uses simple training loop
   - Runs on CPU for reproducibility
   - Demonstrates both model variants (with and without attention)

## How to Run the Fixed Code

1. **Run the minimal example**:
   ```
   uv run run_minimal.py
   ```

2. **Run the simplified main script** (requires tokenizer files):
   ```
   uv run main_simplified.py
   ```

3. **Run the original script** (with fixes implemented):
   ```
   uv run main.py --n_epochs 2 --batch_size 5
   ```

## Additional Improvements

1. **More robust error handling** throughout the code
2. **Better validation of inputs** to catch issues early
3. **Progress reporting** during data preparation
4. **Graceful degradation** when encountering problematic data
5. **Unit tests** for key components to ensure they work independently
